Hi there—

I am a PhD Candidate at ENS Lyon in the field of Computer Science. I work in the ROMA team at the
LIP laboratory under supervision of [Loris Marchal](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/loris.marchal/) (ENS
Lyon, CNRS) and [Louis-Claude Canon](http://lccanon.free.fr/) (Univ. Franche-Comté, FEMTO-ST).

My research interests include _scheduling algorithms_, _optimization in parallel computing_ and
_distributed storage systems_.
