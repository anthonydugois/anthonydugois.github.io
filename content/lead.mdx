Bonjour ! üëã

I am a Non-tenured Teaching and Research Assistant (_Attach√© Temporaire d'Enseignement et de
Recherche_) at Universit√© de Franche-Comt√©, in the marvelous city of Besan√ßon. I teach various
courses in Computer Science, such as basics of programming, networks, as well as compilers and
interpreters.

I was previously a PhD student at ENS Lyon, where I worked under supervision of [Loris
Marchal](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/loris.marchal/) and [Louis-Claude Canon](http://lccanon.free.fr/)
in the LIP laboratory.

My research interests include _scheduling algorithms_, _optimization in parallel computing_ and
_distributed storage systems_. I have also a keen interest in _approximation theory_.
