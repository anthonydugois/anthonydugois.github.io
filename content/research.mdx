I study scheduling problems arising in distributed, replicated and persistent storage systems. The
objective is to derive guarantees on response time and load balancing of these systems in an online
context, that is to say, without any prior knowledge of the workload.

More recently, I started working on alternative analysis techniques for online scheduling problems,
such as learning-augmented scheduling or parameterized worst-case analysis.
