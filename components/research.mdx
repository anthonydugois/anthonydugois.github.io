My research focuses on scheduling problems, a particular class of optimization problems.
These problems aim at assigning jobs to a set of resources (e.g., computer processors) in such a way that a
given objective function is minimized.
I study more specifically online scheduling in distributed storage systems, where scheduling decisions must be taken
without knowing the complete workload.
