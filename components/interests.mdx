In my spare time, I volunteer with the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/) to help raising public awareness of the mechanisms that are at the root of climate change.

I also enjoy experimenting with various recipes in my kitchen (who doesn't love food?) and relaxing in nature during long running sessions.
